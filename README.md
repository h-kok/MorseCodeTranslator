### Morse Code Translator

The MVP is to create a morse code translator using the knowledge we have learnt about objects in Javascript. It also requires us to make use of previously learnt topics, such as the DOM, and testing JS functions.

I have taken a TDD approach to the project, creating tests to determine the expected outcomes of my functions and tackling possible edge cases.
